# A* and HCA* Search Algorithm in Rust

![Rust](https://github.com/gowrizrh/northstar/workflows/Rust/badge.svg?branch=main)

word of caution, this is me learning rust by practice and is my first project
so it is not 100% idiomatic rust! but feel free to explore and open issues

### Todo
- [x] start the project
- [x] basic array map implementation
- [x] implement a*
- [ ] implement hierarchical cooperative pathfinding
- [ ] add a 2d lib visualization!
